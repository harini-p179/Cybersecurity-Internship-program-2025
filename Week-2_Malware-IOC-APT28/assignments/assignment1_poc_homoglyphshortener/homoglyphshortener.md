# HomoglyphShortenerTool.py

This is a simple, educational URL shortener web application built with Python and the Flask framework. It demonstrates how a basic URL shortener works and introduces the concept of *homoglyph attacks* as a security awareness feature.

## Features

  - *URL Shortening*: Generates a random, unique 6-character slug for a long URL.
  - *SQLite Database*: Stores the long URL and its corresponding short slug in a local SQLite database file.
  - *URL Redirection*: Redirects the user from the short URL to the original long URL.
  - *Homoglyph Demonstration*: Displays a non-functional, homoglyph-based URL to visually illustrate how attackers can create deceptive links that look similar to legitimate ones.

## Requirements

  - Python 3.6+
  - Flask
  - sqlite3 (This is part of Python's standard library, so no separate installation is needed.)

## How to Run

1.  *Save the code*: Save the provided code as app.py.
2.  *Install Flask*: If you don't have Flask installed, open your terminal and run:
    bash
    pip install Flask
    
3.  *Run the application*: In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you saved app.py and run:
    bash
    python app.py
    
4.  *Access the app*: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Directory Structure

The application will automatically create the necessary templates directory and urls.db file when you run it for the first time.

## Security Note

This tool is for *educational purposes only*. The homoglyph functionality is a simplified demonstration and does not constitute a real-world phishing tool. The SECRET_KEY is hardcoded for simplicity and should *never* be used in a production environment. Always use a strong, randomly generated key stored in environment variables for a secure application.
